1) Harmony Progression Analyser (Vamp plugin package)

A. General Description

The Harmony Progression Analyser (HPA) is a key, chord and bass simultaneous estimation system that purely relies on machine learning techniques. It also uses a novel choromagram extraction (namely loudness based chromagram) method, which is inspired by loudness perception studies. Compared with other audio chord estimation (ACE) systems, HPA is fast and memory-efficient, achieving an excellent tradeoff between performance and memory and time efÔ¨Åciencies.

The release is the HPA vamp plugin (Win32/Linux32/Linux64/Mac versions) for Sonic Visualiser (http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). The plugin has a user friendly interface and it targets on musicians who are less experienced with additional MATLAB run-time library installation. If you would like to use BATCH PROCESSING for a set of audio files, try our plugins on SONIC ANNOTATOR (http://www.omras2.org/SonicAnnotator).

2) Harmony Progression Analyser (Matlab package)

Harmony_Progression_Analyzer_Toolbox_ver1.2.zip includes the Matlab version of HPA. Since the software package is coded in Matlab, the user needs Matlab2008b or higher versions to run the program. The user can still run the system using old Matlab versions, but he/she may encounter warnings since the program uses containers.Map().

If the system is running on an Apple Macintosh computer, the user needs to run the script "code_compile_shell.m" first to compile the following Mex functions:

    ./Feature_extraction/HPSS_innerLoop.c
    ./HMM_model/bass_viterbiDecoder_c.c
    ./HMM_model/bass_viterbiDecoder_var_c.c
    ./HMM_model/key_viterbiDecoder_c.c
    ./HMM_model/key_viterbiDecoder_var_c.c
    ./HMM_model/viterbiDecoder_c.c

Please refer to READ_ME.txt in the toolbox for detaled instruction.
